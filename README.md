# MatchMind

R code for a flexible Record Linkage model applied on simulated data (see `runsimu.r`) and on [the NLCTS data](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACDA/studies/9681) (see `realdataapplication.r`).

The data files available in the `data` folder are encrypted and formatted for the Record Linkage procedure. The model is applied on the 1982 data and 1994 data waves of the study.
